RFC 1459

2.3 MESSAGES
 ':' prefix ' ' command ' ' command parameters (up to 15 separated by ' ')
-Clients should not use prefix when sending a message from themselves; if they use a prefix, the only valid prefix is theregistered nickname associated with the client
-if the source in the prefix cannot be found, server ignores silently
-Command: must either be a valid IRC command or a three (3) digit number represented in ASCII text

-IRC messages are always lines of characters terminated with a CR-LF (Carriage Return - Line Feed) pair
-these messages shall not exceed 512 characters in length, counting all characters including the trailing CR-LF
-thus, 510 characters maximum allowed for the command and its parameters

2.3.1 MESSAGE FORMAT IN PSEUDO BNF
-The extracted message is parsed into the components <prefix>, <command> and list of parameters matched either by <middle> or <trailing> components
-The BNF representation for this is:

<message>  ::= [':' <prefix> <SPACE> ] <command> <params> <crlf>
<prefix>   ::= <servername> | <nick> [ '!' <user> ] [ '@' <host> ]
<command>  ::= <letter> { <letter> } | <number> <number> <number>
<SPACE>    ::= ' ' { ' ' }
<params>   ::= <SPACE> [ ':' <trailing> | <middle> <params> ]

<middle>   ::= <Any *non-empty* sequence of octets not including SPACE
               or NUL or CR or LF, the first of which may not be ':'>
<trailing> ::= <Any, possibly *empty*, sequence of octets not including
                 NUL or CR or LF>

<crlf>     ::= CR LF
